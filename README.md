# Unit 3 Starter Code 

You will use this starter code to help you plan your Unit 3 project! 

This starter code is meant to help you write the HTML and CSS for your Choose Your Own Adventure easily. Later, you will add all of the JavaScript yourself.

You will eventually change the HTML to match the story you're planning. Feel free to also customize the styling in CSS to make your game look cool and give it your own feel! Definitely also feel free to add MORE parts to the story!

## Instructions
1. Go to the `<title>` tag on line 7 of the HTML. Change the title from "Unit 3 Starter Code 1" to your name and "Unit 2 Project" (For instance if your name is Ahmed, the title should be "Ahmed Unit 3 Project")
2. Open up your project planning document and go to Daily Progress Charts. Based on your task for the day, add to the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript of your project.
